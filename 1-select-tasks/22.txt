Create a SQL query to display the name of each customer along with their most expensive purchased product:

| CompanyName | ProductName | PricePerItem |

SELECT DISTINCT c.CompanyName, p.ProductName, d.UnitPrice AS PricePerItem
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
LEFT JOIN [Order Details] d ON o.OrderID = d.OrderId
LEFT JOIN Products p ON d.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE d.UnitPrice = (
	SELECT MAX(d.UnitPrice) FROM [Order Details] d
	JOIN Orders o ON d.OrderID = o.OrderID
	WHERE c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
)
ORDER BY d.UnitPrice ASC
