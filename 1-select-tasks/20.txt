Create a SQL query to find the employee that sold products for the largest amount:

| EmployeeId | Employee Full Name | Amount, $ |

SELECT TOP 1 e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName + ' ' + E.LastName AS FullName, SUM(d.UnitPrice * d.Quantity) AS [Amount, $]
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID
LEFT JOIN[Order Details] d ON o.OrderID = d.OrderID
GROUP BY e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
ORDER BY [Amount, $] DESC
