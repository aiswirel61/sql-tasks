Create a SQL query to display customer details whose total orders amount is more than 10000$:

| CustomerId | CompanyName | TotalOrdersAmount, $ |

SELECT c.CustomerID, c.CompanyName, SUM(d.UnitPrice * d.Quantity) AS [TotalOrdersAmount, $]
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN [Order Details] d ON o.OrderID = d.OrderID
GROUP BY C.CompanyName, C.CustomerID
HAVING SUM(d.UnitPrice * d.Quantity) > 10000
